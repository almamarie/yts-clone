<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

- Where can I see your demo?

[Link to app site](https://shoppingify-frontend-jet.vercel.app/). The application was deployed on vercel with firebase as the backend.
Vercel gives a different ip address to each build. I have configured the application to rebuild whenever there is a puch in the master branch.Because I am still developing, there is not 1 link I can give for the project. I will therefore share the latest build here.

- What was your experience and What have you learned/improved?

  In order to improve my skills, I always learn a new thing after every project and use it to build the next project which is always tougher than the previous project (this project's difficulty is rated 5/6 on devchallenge ).

  - The previous projects were built with:

    - Frontend: React.js.
    - Backend: Flask + postgres.
    - Python was built with types included.

  - New skills after previous project:

    - Typescript
    - Next.js

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This project is a clone of [the Official YTS website](https://yts.mx) and so mimics the feature of the website

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.
Note that the project was created with node 18. You must have it installed in order to run the application successfully. The right Typescript and Next.js versions are automatically downloaded when ypu install the dependencies as outlined below.
From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/almamarie/yts-clone.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

It has been configured to automatically deploy when there is an update on the master branch.
- Backend: [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
